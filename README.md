## simple_shell
The objective of this project is to create from scratch a simple shell with limited functionality but applying the core concepts of a more rubust shell.

## Learning objectives
* How does a shell work.
* What is a pid and a ppid, and how to use them.
* How to manipulate the environment of the current process.
* What is the difference between a function and a system call.
* How to create processes.
* How does the shell use the ```PATH``` to find the programs.
* How to execute another program with the ```execve``` system call.
* How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates.

## Description of a shell
In simple words, the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. It incorporates many features and generally executes other commands.

## Requirements
Installed gcc (GNU Compiler Collection) version 4.8.4 or newer.

## Example
### Clone repo using HTTPS
